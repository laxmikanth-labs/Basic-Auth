üîê Basic Authentication in ASP.NET Core
Basic Authentication is a simple authentication mechanism where the client sends a username and password encoded in Base64 with every HTTP request. It‚Äôs typically used for internal or low-security APIs and should always be used over HTTPS to prevent credentials from being intercepted.

In ASP.NET Core, Basic Authentication can be implemented by creating a custom authentication handler that:

Reads the Authorization header from the request

Decodes the credentials

Validates the username and password (e.g., from a hardcoded list or database)

Sets the HttpContext.User for authorized access

‚úÖ Key Features
